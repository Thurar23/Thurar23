# Hey! It's nice to meet you!
Welcome to my GitHub page!
I'm a guy fascinated by programming from Brazil<br>
Now i am 15 years old!

### programming languages that I know (until now):
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)<br>
Just a reminder that I'm a beginner in those languages and I know more about C++ than the others
